I want to simplify nginx proxying for FOCUSA.
Nginx can perform static file proxying based for FOCUSA, relieving FOCUSA's 
nodeJS script from unnecessary overload. It's really simple,

1. Any HTTP request with the URI "/public/*" will not be forwarded to nodeJS.
Instead, nginx will directly process that request and transfer the static file.

2. Any other HTTP request will be forwarded to nodeJS. This means that the 
overhead of content delivery has been averted from FOCUSA's main script.

3. Nginx has multithreaded, multi-channel support(serves static files faster
than nodeJS), and has a surprisingly small memory footprint(smaller than
FOCUSA), and will actually perform the task of static file serving(content
delivery) more easily.

4. Also, FOCUSA's memory usage dropped drastically after I removed static file
serving(it may have been buffering the files)!
MEMORY USAGE:
	FOCUSA(with static file serving) >> FOCUSA(without static file serving) + nginx

5. This means that FOCUSA's main script only needs to perform the task of 
content management, not content delivery anymore!!

Hooray to efficiency and optimization!
